# Baseline vs Recursive: AIME 2025 Comparison

## Overview
Compared **Baseline (single-shot)** vs **RecursiveThink** on first 5 AIME 2025 problems using Mistral `mistral-large-latest`.

---

## Results Summary

| Approach | Correct | Accuracy | Avg Time/Problem |
|----------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Baseline (k=1)** | 5/5 | **100%** | ~24s |
| **RecursiveThink** | 3/5 | **60%** | ~50s |

> **Key Finding**: With sufficient token limit (4096), single-shot baseline **outperforms** recursive approach on these 5 problems!

## Problem-by-Problem Breakdown

| Problem | Expected | Baseline | Recursive |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| id_01 | 70 | ✅ 70 | ✅ 70 (5 steps) |
| id_02 | 588 | ✅ 588 | ❌ None (5 steps) |
| id_03 | 16 | ✅ 16 | ✅ 16 (4 steps) |
| id_04 | 117 | ✅ 117 | ✅ 117 (5 steps) |
| id_05 | 279 | ✅ 279 | ❌ None (2 steps) |

## Key Findings

### 1. Token Limit Was Critical
Initial baseline (max_tokens=1024) scored **0%** because responses were truncated before `\boxed{}` answer.
After increasing to 4096 tokens: **100% accuracy**.

### 2. Baseline is Faster
- Baseline: ~24s per problem (single API call)
- Recursive: ~50s per problem (4-5 iterative calls)

### 3. Recursive Failed on Harder Problems
- id_02 and id_05 failed to produce boxed answers even after 5 steps
- Iterative refinement didn't help on these complex problems

### 4. When to Use Each Approach

| Use Case | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Simple/Medium problems | Baseline (faster) |
| Need reasoning trace | Recursive |
| Token-limited model | Recursive (chunked) |
| Maximum accuracy | Baseline + high tokens |

## Configuration

```
Baseline:
  - System prompt: Explicit \boxed{} instruction
  - max_tokens: 4096
  - k=1 (single sample)

Recursive:
  - max_steps: 8
  - confidence_threshold: 0.9
  - Provider: mistral-large-latest
```
