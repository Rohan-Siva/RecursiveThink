## Problem-by-Problem Breakdown

| Problem | Expected | Recursive | Baseline |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| id_01 | 70 | ✅ 70 (5 steps) | ❌ None |
| id_02 | 588 | ❌ None (5 steps) | ❌ None |
| id_03 | 16 | ✅ 16 (4 steps) | ❌ None |
| id_04 | 117 | ✅ 117 (5 steps) | ❌ None |
| id_05 | 279 | ❌ None (2 steps) | ❌ None |

## Key Findings

### 1. Recursive Approach Significantly Outperforms Baseline
- **60% vs 0%** accuracy on same problems
- Iterative refinement helps model arrive at correct answers

### 2. Baseline Fails to Format Answers
The single-shot baseline failed to extract any answers because the model didn't consistently use `\\boxed{}` format without the structured JSON output requirement.

### 3. Iterative Confidence Building Works
Recursive approach started with low confidence (0.3-0.4) and iteratively refined to 0.95:
- id_01: 0.40 → 0.60 → 0.70 → ... → 0.95 ✅
- id_03: 0.30 → 0.50 → 0.75 → 0.95 ✅
- id_04: 0.30 → 0.70 → 0.85 → 0.95 ✅

### 4. Some Problems Remain Hard
Both approaches failed on id_02 (588) and id_05 (279), suggesting these require either:
- More reasoning steps
- Different problem-solving strategies
- Or are genuinely beyond model capability

## Recommendations

1. **Use RecursiveThink for complex math** — significantly better than single-shot
2. **Increase max_steps for harder problems** — id_02 may have succeeded with more iterations
3. **Consider Pass@k > 1 for baseline** — multiple samples may help
