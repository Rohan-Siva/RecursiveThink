## Final Results Summary

| Approach | Correct | Accuracy | Avg Steps | Avg Time |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Baseline (k=1)** | 5/5 | **100%** | 1 | ~24s |
| **RecursiveThink (improved)** | 5/5 | **100%** | 1.4 | ~30s |
| RecursiveThink (old prompts) | 3/5 | 60% | 4.2 | ~50s |

## Problem-by-Problem Breakdown

| Problem | Expected | Baseline | Recursive (new) | Recursive (old) |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| id_01 | 70 | ✅ | ✅ 1 step | ✅ 5 steps |
| id_02 | 588 | ✅ | ✅ 1 step | ❌ failed |
| id_03 | 16 | ✅ | ✅ 1 step | ✅ 4 steps |
| id_04 | 117 | ✅ | ✅ 2 steps | ✅ 5 steps |
| id_05 | 279 | ✅ | ✅ 2 steps | ❌ failed |

## Key Findings

### 1. Ablation-Informed Prompts Dramatically Improved Recursive
After applying lessons from ablation study:
- Accuracy: **60% → 100%** (+40%)
- Avg steps: **4.2 → 1.4** (3x faster)

### 2. What Improved Recursive Performance
Based on ablation study (see `ablation_results.readme`):
- ✅ **Expert persona**: "world-class expert problem solver"
- ✅ **CoT markers**: "Let me think through this..."
- ✅ **Removed self-attribution**: "your solution" → "the solution"
- ✅ **Confidence framing**: "Be confident in your expert assessment"

### 3. Token Limit Was Critical for Baseline
Initial baseline (max_tokens=1024) scored 0% due to truncation.
After increasing to 4096 tokens: 100% accuracy.

## When to Use Each Approach

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Need reasoning trace | Recursive |
| Maximum speed | Baseline |
| Token-limited API | Recursive |
| Complex multi-step | Recursive |
| Simple problems | Either |
